## About The Project

This game is a magic themed card game, but its powered by AI. The characters, images, and effects of cards are all generated by Gemini AI. Additionally, each turn's logic is also handled by AI.

### How it Works:

-   A set of characters are taken from a Firebase database
-   A new set of characters and their images will then be generated and put into the database
-   Players will be able to use the first set of characters to play with
-   Gemini will handle all of the card logic during the game

### Built With

## Why I Built This

Card games have a great potential when paired with AI. My goal was to create many possibilities of cards and card effects through the use of AI. There are also many directions in which this project can be taken, for example, prompt engineering the AI to handle damage based on an effect's natural strengths and weaknesses.
